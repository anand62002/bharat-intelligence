**Progress: 52 / 58 items complete (90%)**

### Dashboard holes identified (2026-05-15)
| Issue | Root cause | Fix status |
|---|---|---|
| Discovery tab: "13 passed, 2 promoted" but blank recs | `valid_till < today` filter in 7d fallback excluded all recs | ✅ Fixed: 14d window, no valid_till filter |
| Portfolio recs tab always empty | Orchestrator generates recs for screener universe, not portfolio-specific | ✅ Fixed: DB-8 toggle "All / My Holdings" in recs tab |
| Governance: duplicate STOPLOSS_HIT per stock | API used wrong field (portfolio_id→holding_id); WebSocket broadcaster pushed all raw rows every 30s overriding dedup | ✅ Fixed: dedup by holding_id/symbol in both REST + WebSocket; SQL to bulk-resolve 107 stale DB rows |
| Performance tab no data | recommendation_outcomes table empty (recs < 90 days old) | ✅ DB-6: PerformanceTab already built; awaiting first 90-day recs |
| Market tab: empty news | No RSS-per-stock feed integrated in dashboard | ✅ Fixed: DB-7 Google News RSS panel with topic filter buttons |
| Screener returning standalone figures instead of consolidated | URL order was standalone-first; Reliance PE was 42x instead of 22.8x | ✅ Fixed: consolidated/ tried first |
| No visibility into data source failures without checking logs | No health endpoint or UI panel | ✅ Fixed: /api/system/health + Governance panel |

## ✅ COMPLETED — Pre-work

### ✅ Pre-1: `earnings_calendar` DB Migration
**Status:** Done 2026-05-04  
**What was done:** Created `db/migrations/create_earnings_calendar.sql` and ran it in Supabase. Fixed partial index error (removed `WHERE earnings_date >= CURRENT_DATE` — `CURRENT_DATE` is volatile, not IMMUTABLE). Table created with `idx_ec_symbol` and `idx_ec_date` indexes.

### ✅ Pre-2: Seed 150 Historical RAG Events
**Status:** Done 2026-05-04  
**What was done:** Fixed RLS violation on `historical_events` table (disabled RLS entirely — static public reference table has no user-specific rows). Ran `python -m db.seed_historical_events_comprehensive --append` successfully. 150 events seeded.  
**Key fix recorded in:** `db/migrations/grant_service_role_rls.sql` → Section 6 now uses `ALTER TABLE historical_events DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`.

---

## ✅ COMPLETED — Phase 0 (All 6 items done 2026-05-04)

> All Phase 0 changes improve the **next production run** (06:00 IST daily). No manual steps needed.

### ✅ P0-A: Sector-Specific WACC
**Files changed:** `agents/valuation_scenarios.py`, `agents/warren_bot.py`  
**What changed:**
- Added `_SECTOR_WACC` dict in `valuation_scenarios.py` (FMCG/Healthcare 10% → Aviation 15%)
- Added `_get_sector_wacc(sector)` function — sector from `raw.get("sector")` via screener
- Added `_SECTOR_DISCOUNT_RATES` + `_get_sector_discount_rate(sector)` in `warren_bot.py`
- `_dcf_valuation()` now accepts optional `discount_rate` param; `analyse()` passes sector WACC from yfinance `info["sector"]`
- Hardcoded `DISCOUNT_RATE = 0.12` now only a fallback for unknown sectors

**Impact:** FMCG/Pharma intrinsic values increase (lower discount rate → higher NPV). Aviation/Metals values decrease (higher WACC → more conservative). Systematic, not arbitrary.

### ✅ P0-B: Stock-Specific Macro Sensitivities
**Files changed:** `agents/macro.py`, `scheduler/orchestrator.py`, `agents/discovery_screener.py`  
**What changed:**
- Added `get_sector_adjusted_macro_score(macro_result, sector)` at bottom of `agents/macro.py`
- Adjusts raw macro score ±8 pts based on `sector_impacts` already in macro result (IT+8 under weak INR, Oil&Gas -8, etc.)
- Returns `sector_adjusted=True` flag — prevents double-adjustment on repeat calls
- `orchestrator.py` `_run_agents_for_symbol()` calls this after Phase 1 fundamental result returns sector
- `discovery_screener.py` `_run_all_agents()` calls this after fundamental result

**Impact:** Every stock in a pipeline run now gets a different macro score reflecting its own sector's sensitivity. Before: all stocks identical.

### ✅ P0-C: warren_bot Notes Column Bug
**Files changed:** None  
**What found:** Already correct in current code. `_log_to_supabase()` only inserts `agent_name` + `audit_date`. No notes column attempted. Issue was already resolved prior to this session.

### ✅ P0-D: DCF Owner Earnings — Maintenance CapEx Adjustment
**File changed:** `agents/valuation_scenarios.py`  
**What changed:** `oe_list.append(pat + dep - capex)` → `oe_list.append(pat + dep - 0.6 * capex)`  
**Impact:** Owner earnings increase for capital-heavy businesses (only 60% of capex is treated as maintenance, 40% is growth investment that creates future value). Warren_bot already used this methodology — now both DCF engines are aligned.

### ✅ P0-E: Discovery CRITICAL Tier — Data Quality Gate + New Threshold
**File changed:** `agents/discovery_screener.py`  
**What changed:**
- `_CRITICAL_UPSIDE` changed from `100.0` → `40.0` (see P0-E rationale below)
- `_CRITICAL_CONF` changed from `70.0` → `75.0`
- Classification block now checks `fund_data_quality` before assigning CRITICAL tier
- If `data_quality` is ESTIMATED / NO_DATA / PARTIAL → demoted to STANDARD (not dropped)

**CRITICAL threshold rationale (why 40%, not 100%):**
> The old 100% upside threshold was a broken signal. On NSE, genuine 100% upside opportunities that pass multi-agent validation are vanishingly rare — the threshold was hit almost exclusively by screener data artefacts (stale earnings data for micro-caps, incorrect market cap fields). The new threshold `≥40% upside + ≥75% confidence + real data` is:
> - **Achievable for real stocks** — a Nifty 500 stock trading at a 30% discount to fair value with 10% expected earnings growth shows ~40% upside
> - **Meaningfully distinct from STANDARD** — 2× the upside bar (40 vs 20%) AND tighter confidence (75 vs 65%)
> - **Actionable signal** — 40%+ upside with high conviction warrants immediate attention; it's not a data error
> - **Protected by data gate** — only fires on real PAT data, not FCF proxy estimates

**What CRITICAL now means:** "This stock has been analysed with real fundamental data, shows ≥40% upside to fair value at ≥75% agent confidence — act on this at priority."

### ✅ P0-F: Replace Index-Level FII Filter in Discovery Pre-Screen
**File changed:** `agents/discovery_screener.py`  
**What changed:**
- Filter 3 in `prescreen()` replaced: was `_fii_net_buying(fii_data)` (NSE aggregate FII net flow — same value for all 200 symbols screened)
- Now: `institutional_holding_pct ≥ 5%` from screener data (stock-specific)
- Threshold simplified to 4-of-5 always (no more 3-of-4 relaxed path)
- `_fii_net_buying()` kept for API compatibility with a deprecation note

**Impact:** Filter 3 now measures whether smart money is actually present in this specific stock. Before, a day where FII sold ₹3,000cr of index futures would disqualify all 200 stocks regardless of whether they individually had FII ownership.

### ✅ P1-D: Confidence Calibration — Tighten Fallback Thresholds
**File changed:** `scheduler/orchestrator.py`  
**What changed:** `_fallback_synthesis()` thresholds:
- `≥72 = BUY` → `≥75 = BUY`  
- `≥55 = HOLD` → `≥58 = HOLD`
- `≤35 = AVOID` → `≤30 = AVOID`

**Impact:** Fewer BUY signals from the score-based fallback path (when Claude synthesis is unavailable). More conservative, reduces false positives.

## ⬜ PHASE 1 — Core Infrastructure Gaps

---

### ✅ P1-A: Historical Backtest Framework
**Status:** Done 2026-05-09  
**New files:** `agents/backtester.py`, `db/migrations/create_backtest_results.sql`  
**Modified:** `api/main.py` (`GET /api/backtest/summary`), `worker.py` (monthly job)  
**New DB table:** `backtest_results`

**What was built:**

#### `agents/backtester.py` — full walk-forward engine
1. **Quality Universe** — downloads NIFTY 500 constituent list from NSE archives CSV; falls back to YF_SYMBOL_MAP if NSE is unreachable. Filters: market cap > ₹500 Cr via yfinance `fast_info`.
2. **Indicators** — RSI(14) via Wilder EMA smoothing, EMA(200), MACD(12,26,9) + bullish crossover detection.
3. **Signal logic** — BUY: RSI 40–65 AND price > EMA200 AND MACD bullish crossover. EXIT: RSI > 75 OR price < entry × 0.85 (15% SL) OR 90 days elapsed.
4. **Alpha measurement** — each trade's 90d and 180d return vs NIFTY 50 (^NSEI) over the same holding period.
5. **Walk-forward split** — TRAIN 2020–2022 (in-sample) | TEST 2023–2024 (out-of-sample). TEST is the meaningful metric.
6. **Metrics** — `hit_rate_90d` (% signals beating NIFTY), `avg_alpha_90d/180d`, `sharpe_ratio` (mean/std of alpha across trades), `max_drawdown` (worst single trade), `win_loss_ratio`.
7. **DB persistence** — inserts 3 rows per run (TRAIN, TEST, FULL) into `backtest_results`.

#### CLI
```powershell
python -m agents.backtester                          # default: 80 symbols, 2020–2024
python -m agents.backtester --max-symbols 30 --dry-run  # quick test
python -m agents.backtester --start 2021-01-01 --end 2024-12-31
```

#### API endpoint
```
GET /api/backtest/summary?split=TEST&limit=5
```
Returns last 5 monthly run summaries for the requested split.

#### Worker schedule
Monthly on 1st of month at 07:45 IST. Takes ~20–30 min for 80 symbols.

#### ⚠️ MANUAL STEP REQUIRED
**Run in Supabase SQL Editor:**
```sql
-- db/migrations/create_backtest_results.sql
```
The table must exist before the first backtest run or job save will fail silently.

### ✅ P1-B: Options Real Data Feed — ICICI Breeze Connect
**Status:** Done 2026-05-11  
**Provider chosen:** ICICI Breeze Connect (free — user has ICICI Direct demat account)  
**New files:** `data/breeze_auth.py`  
**Modified:** `data/options_fetcher.py`, `worker.py`, `requirements.txt`

**What was built:**

#### `data/breeze_auth.py` — Session manager
- `get_breeze_client()` — returns a configured `BreezeConnect` instance with 23-hour in-memory cache
- `refresh_session()` — supports two modes:
  - **Auto**: Uses `ICICI_USER_ID + ICICI_PASSWORD + BREEZE_TOTP_SECRET` to POST to ICICI login, parse redirect URL for session token — fully hands-off
  - **Manual**: Validates `BREEZE_SESSION_TOKEN` env var, logs hours remaining + reminder when expiring
- CLI: `python data/breeze_auth.py` / `--dry-run`

#### `data/options_fetcher.py` — Breeze as primary source (priority 1 of 3)
New functions added:
- `_get_near_expiry_date()` — computes next Thursday as Breeze-format expiry (`YYYY-MM-DDT06:00:00.000Z`)
- `_get_underlying_price(symbol)` — fast yfinance spot price lookup
- `_build_strike_range(spot, step, pct=0.08)` — generates ±8% strike range aligned to step
- `_fetch_breeze_option_chain(symbol)` — two-strategy fetch:
  1. **Bulk**: `get_option_chain_quotes(strike_price="")` for full chain in 2 calls (CE + PE)
  2. **Parallel**: Individual strikes via `ThreadPoolExecutor(10)` as fallback (~10s for 40 strikes)
  - 15-minute in-process cache per symbol
- `_parse_breeze_chain(rows, spot)` — converts Breeze rows → PCR, max pain, ATM IV, IV skew
- Source priority in `get_option_metrics()`: **breeze → nse → fallback** (was nse → fallback)
- Breeze result enriched with India VIX + HV20 from yfinance (for iv_hv_ratio)

#### `worker.py` — Daily token refresh job
- `job_breeze_token_refresh()` added
- Scheduled at **08:30 IST** (after earnings calendar 08:00, before first options snapshot 09:15)
- Auto-refreshes if `ICICI_USER_ID/PASSWORD/BREEZE_TOTP_SECRET` set; else logs manual reminder

#### `agents/options_sentiment.py` — No changes needed
Existing scoring logic (PCR, max pain, VIX, IV skew, IV/HV) works unchanged with any source.

**What improves when Breeze is active:**
- `source` changes from `"fallback"` → `"breeze"` in all `options_snapshot` logs
- PCR: real strike-level OI ratios instead of VIX-linear estimate
- Max pain: exact computation from actual OI vs heuristic σ estimate
- ATM IV: real implied vol from live option quote vs India VIX proxy
- IV skew: real put/call IV differential vs `None` (previously always missing)

**⚠️ Manual setup required on Railway:**

**Minimum (manual token, daily rotation):**
```
BREEZE_API_KEY=<from ICICI Direct API portal>
BREEZE_API_SECRET=<from ICICI Direct API portal>
BREEZE_SESSION_TOKEN=<fresh token, see steps below>
```

**How to get BREEZE_SESSION_TOKEN daily:**
1. Visit: `https://api.icicidirect.com/apiuser/login?api_key=<BREEZE_API_KEY>`
2. Login with ICICI Direct credentials + TOTP from your authenticator app
3. Copy the `code=` value from the redirect URL
4. Set `BREEZE_SESSION_TOKEN=<code>` in Railway worker + web env vars

**Optional (fully automated daily refresh — recommended):**
```
ICICI_USER_ID=<your ICICI login ID>
ICICI_PASSWORD=<your ICICI password>
BREEZE_TOTP_SECRET=<base32 secret from 2FA setup>
```
To find your TOTP secret: scan the QR code in your ICICI 2FA setup with a TOTP secret extractor app (or your authenticator app's export feature).

**Install dependency:**
```powershell
pip install breeze-connect pyotp
```
(Already added to `requirements.txt` — Railway deploys automatically)

### ✅ P1-C: GPT-4o-mini as Independent 3rd Validation Judge
**Status:** Done 2026-05-11  
**Files changed:** `scheduler/synthesis_validator.py`

**What was built:**
- Replaced 3rd judge (was `claude-haiku`) with `gpt-4o-mini` (genuine model diversity)
- Added lazy-init to `_call_anthropic_judge`: if `ant_client=None` at startup, reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from env and constructs its own Anthropic client on demand. Prevents auth failures when client is passed as None from the orchestrator.
- All 3 judges now have self-healing lazy-init: GPT-4o-mini, Claude Sonnet, Claude Opus all initialise their own clients if the passed-in client is None.

**Cost:** ~₹40-80/month (negligible — OpenAI key already in stack for embeddings)

## ✅ SESSION: Bug Fixes + Enhancements (2026-05-12)

> These were not in the original execution plan but were diagnosed and fixed in response to live system observations.

### ✅ BF-1: yfinance 1.2.0 — All Portfolio Prices Stuck at Upload Price
**Root cause:** yfinance 1.2.0 removed the `progress=` parameter from `history()`. All calls used `progress=False` which raised `TypeError`, silently caught by `except Exception: return None`. Every price refresh returned None for weeks.

**Additional yfinance 1.x issue:** yfinance now appends today's incomplete candle as `NaN` as the last row. `float(df["Close"].iloc[-1])` returned `float(NaN)` — broke discovery screener DataCompletenessValidator (every stock failed price>0 check).

**Files fixed:** `api/main.py`, `data/options_fetcher.py`, `agents/backtester.py`, `agents/discovery_screener.py`
- Removed `progress=False` from all `yf.history()` / `yf.download()` calls
- Added `.dropna()` before `iloc[-1]` in all price extractions
- `api/main.py _fetch_current_price`: added period fallback loop (1d → 5d → 1mo) — needed for BSE-only stocks (e.g. GE Vernova `522275.BO` returns empty on `period='1d'`)

---

### ✅ BF-2: Discovery Screener — 0 Pre-Screen Passes
Three bugs combined to produce 0 discoveries every day:

1. **NaN close price** (yfinance 1.x trailing row) — DataCompletenessValidator failed every stock. Fixed with `.dropna()`.
2. **Wrong screener field name** — code used `raw.get("fii_holding")` but screener.in returns `fii_holding_pct` + `dii_holding_pct`. HDFCBANK's 84% institutional holding was invisible → filter 3 always 0 < 5%. Fixed with correct field names + legacy fallback.
3. **Threshold 4/5 impossible** — `revenue_growth` almost always `None` from screener.in (multi-year data, no single figure), so max achievable was 4 filters. Lowered `_MIN_PRESCREEN_PASS` from 4 → 3.

**Verified:** HDFCBANK PASS (RSI 45.7 ✓, PE 15.7 ✓, institutional 84.2% ✓), BAJFINANCE PASS (4/5), DIXON correctly skipped (earnings guard).

---

### ✅ BF-3: FII Stale-Zero Data Masking NO_DATA State
**Root cause:** `institutional_flows` table had rows with `fii_net=0.0, dii_net=0.0` since April 22 (stored when NSE API was blocked and no live data available). `_fetch_historical_flows` returned these zero rows, which `_build_flow_history` included — making `data_quality="PARTIAL"` when it should be `"NO_DATA"`. Score of 50 (neutral) was being produced for the wrong reasons.

**Fix:** `_fetch_historical_flows` now filters out rows where both `fii_net=0.0` AND `dii_net=0.0` (treated as missing-data placeholders). Over-fetches 3× rows to survive filtering. Logs a warning when all DB rows are zero.

### ✅ BF-4: India Macro News Monitoring (PM Modi / RBI / Budget Announcements)
**Problem:** Macro agent only read FRED + RBI repo rate + VIX/INR. Major political/policy announcements (PM Modi speech, budget surprise, geopolitical event) were completely invisible until they showed up in price action.

**Fix added to `agents/macro.py`:**
- `_fetch_india_macro_news()`: fetches Google News RSS for 4 India macro query terms. Also uses NewsAPI if `NEWSAPI_KEY` set. No API key required for RSS path.
- `_score_macro_news()`: keyword-matches positive events (rate cut, trade deal, GST record) and negative shocks (war, tariff hike, capital flight). Returns ±10 score adjustment.
- `analyse()` now calls this as Step 1c. Adds `macro_news_signal` + `macro_news_events` to top-level output for synthesiser. Score adjustment applied to base indicator total.

---

### ✅ BF-5: Historical Events Embeddings Backfill
**Problem:** 150 events in `historical_events` table, only 52 had OpenAI embeddings, 98 were NULL. RAG agent was falling back to keyword-TF-IDF for 65% of the corpus.

**Fix:** Created `db/backfill_embeddings.py` — generates `text-embedding-3-small` (1536-dim) vectors for rows missing embeddings. **All 98 generated and stored.** Table is now 150/150 complete.

**Cost:** ~$0.0002 (98 rows × ~80 tokens at $0.02/1M).

---

### ✅ BF-6: ARIA Partial Sell Support + Backend Field-Clobber Fix
**Problem:** Selling 125 of 140 Voltas shares deleted the entire position (should leave 15 shares).

Three bugs:
1. **ARIA system prompt** had no `qty` field in exit JSON → ARIA couldn't express partial quantity
2. **`handlePortfolioUpdate`** always marked the full holding as "exited" regardless of qty
3. **`upsert_portfolio` backend** rebuilt the entire row from defaults on every update — `{symbol, status:"CLOSED"}` would set `qty=1`, `avg_buy=0`, etc. before closing

**Fix:**
- ARIA system prompt: added `qty` (required), explicit partial sell instructions
- `handlePortfolioUpdate`: checks `soldQty < holding.qty` → partial (reduce qty, keep status=holding) vs full exit
- `upsert_portfolio` backend: UPDATE path now only touches fields explicitly present in payload; INSERT path unchanged

---

### ✅ BF-7: Symbol Resolution — SHAKTIPUMPS, GEVERNOVA, ELFORGE
- `SHAKTIPUMPS` → `SHAKTIPUMP.NS` (NSE ticker drops trailing S)
- `GEVERNOVA` / `GE VERNOVA` / `GETDINDIA` → `522275.BO` (GE Vernova T&D India — only on BSE in Yahoo Finance, quoteType=MUTUALFUND)
- `ELFORGE` → `ELFORGE.BO` (BSE-listed only)

Added to both `data/symbol_map.py::YF_SYMBOL_MAP` and `api/main.py::_NSE_OVERRIDES`.

---

## ⬜ PHASE 2 — Signal Quality Improvements

---

### ✅ P2-A: Data Provider Diversification — yfinance Fallback
**Status:** Done 2026-05-12  
**Files changed:** `data/fetchers.py`, `agents/fundamental.py`, `agents/discovery_screener.py`

**What was built:**

#### `data/fetchers.py` — `_get_yfinance_fundamentals()`
New function extracts fundamentals from `yfinance Ticker.info` — completely free, no API key, already in stack. Maps to the same output schema as `get_screener_data()`:
- `pe` (trailingPE), `revenue_growth` (revenueGrowth ×100), `ebitda_margin` (operatingMargins ×100)
- `debt_equity` (debtToEquity ÷100), `roce` (returnOnAssets ×100 as proxy), `roe` (returnOnEquity ×100)
- `fii_holding_pct` + `dii_holding_pct` estimated from `heldPercentInstitutions` (60/40 split)
- `ocf_margin` (operatingCashflow ÷ totalRevenue ×100), `sector`, `market_cap`
- Returns `data_source: "yfinance_fallback"` so agents know which path was taken

`get_screener_data()`: when all screener.in URL variants fail (IP block on Railway), calls yfinance fallback. Returns None only if both fail.

#### `agents/fundamental.py` — data quality tracking
- Detects fallback via `raw.get("data_source") == "yfinance_fallback"`
- `data_sources` gets `"yfinance_fundamentals"` instead of `"screener_in"`
- Result now includes `data_quality` key: `"FULL"` for screener.in, `"FALLBACK"` for yfinance
- `data_quality` was previously missing entirely — discovery screener gate never fired

#### `agents/discovery_screener.py` — FALLBACK ≠ ESTIMATED
- `"FALLBACK"` is NOT in the `is_estimated` blocked list — CRITICAL tier still allowed
- yfinance data is real market data, just less complete (no CAGR, no promoter pledging split)
- Logs when CRITICAL promotion uses fallback data

**Decision: yfinance over Trendlyne (₹999/month)**
yfinance provides the most critical fields (P/E, ROE, operating margin, revenue growth, D/E, institutional %) and is already in the stack with zero cost. Trendlyne would add CAGR series and promoter pledging but requires manual API signup + monthly cost. Can add Trendlyne as a second fallback later if needed.

**Fields NOT available in yfinance fallback (returned as None):**
`revenue_cagr_3y`, `revenue_cagr_5y`, `eps_cagr_5y`, `promoter_pledging`, `interest_coverage`, exact FII/DII split

**Verified:** RELIANCE.NS → pe=23.3, roe=9.1, revg=12.5%, ebitda=9.98%, de=0.37

---

### ✅ P2-B: Historical RAG Corpus Auto-Refresh
**Status:** Done 2026-05-12  
**Files:** `db/auto_seed_rag.py` (new), `worker.py` (monthly job added), `tests/test_auto_seed_rag.py` (74 tests, all passing)

**What was built:**

#### `db/auto_seed_rag.py` — monthly RAG event seeder
- Fetches India macro/market news from **8 Google News RSS queries** (no API key needed) for the last 35 days
- **Keyword relevance pre-filter** (`_is_relevant`) — 40+ keywords gate articles before any LLM call; eliminates company-specific micro news and irrelevant articles
- **Classification** — two-tier:
  - *Primary*: `gpt-4o-mini` structured JSON with enum-constrained output (event_type + market_impact + sectors + outcome + is_significant) — used when `OPENAI_API_KEY` set
  - *Fallback*: Pure keyword-rule classifier (`_classify_keyword_fallback`) — always available, zero cost; covers 18 event types, uses `re.search` word-boundary matching to avoid substring false positives (e.g. "flows" ≠ "low")
- **Deduplication** (`_deduplicate_articles`) — fetches existing events from DB, skips any article whose `event_type` already has an entry within ±7 days (prevents duplicate RBI / Budget / FII entries for same real event)
- **Embedding generation** — `text-embedding-3-small` when OpenAI key available; otherwise inserts with `embedding=NULL` for `backfill_embeddings.py` to handle later
- **Cap** — max 30 new events per run (configurable via `--max`)
- **Returns** `{added, skipped_duplicate, skipped_irrelevant, errors, articles_checked, dry_run}`

#### CLI
```powershell
python -m db.auto_seed_rag                  # dry-run: show what would be added
python -m db.auto_seed_rag --run            # actually insert + embed
python -m db.auto_seed_rag --run --days 60  # look back 60 days
python -m db.auto_seed_rag --run --max 20   # cap at 20 events
```

#### `worker.py` — monthly job
- `job_rag_refresh()` added
- Scheduled at **08:15 IST on 1st of each month** (after backtest 07:45 + earnings calendar 08:00)
- Logs: `added / skipped_dup / skipped_irrel / errors / articles_checked`

#### Bug caught during testing
- Python substring trap: `"low" in "flows"` is `True` — "capital flows" was triggering CURRENCY_CRISIS. Fixed with `re.search(r"\b(fall|fallen|low|weak|...)\b", text)` word-boundary matching in `_classify_keyword_fallback`.

---

### ✅ P2-C: Portfolio-Level Concentration Alerts *(completed 2026-05-12)*
**Problem:** Individual holdings monitored but no portfolio-level concentration flagging.  
**Fix:** Alerts when >40% portfolio value in one sector, or 3+ holdings with same macro sensitivity.  
**Files:** `scheduler/portfolio_monitor.py` (`_check_concentration()`, `_get_macro_sensitivity()`, `_portfolio_alert_exists()`)  
**Tests:** `tests/test_portfolio_concentration.py` — 54 tests, all passing  
**Key details:**
- `_MACRO_SENSITIVITY_MAP` — 5 macro categories (Rate-Sensitive, USD-Sensitive, Domestic Demand, Commodity-Linked, Infra/Capex) with word-boundary regex matching
- SECTOR_CONCENTRATION: severity=WARNING, alert_type fires when any known sector > 40% of portfolio value; "Other"/uncategorised excluded
- MACRO_CLUSTER: severity=WARNING fires when ≥ 3 holdings share same macro sensitivity category
- `_portfolio_alert_exists()` deduplicates by alert_type + symbol (not holding_id) with 24h window
- `holding_id=None` on portfolio-level alerts (no specific holding); enriched holdings with fresh prices fed in from `run()`

---

### ⬜ P2-D: Earnings Calendar Auto-Population
**Current state:** `earnings_calendar` table exists but is empty after initial seed — no ongoing refresh.  
**Fix:** `data/earnings_fetcher.py` populates from NSE bulletin + yfinance for portfolio + watchlist symbols. Daily at 08:30 IST.  
**Files:** `data/earnings_fetcher.py`, `worker.py`

> ⚠️ **Note:** P2-D will be superseded by P3-C Pillar 2 (Trendlyne corporate actions → earnings_calendar). Implement P2-D only if P3-C is not prioritised first — avoid duplicating the earnings calendar pipeline.

---

## ⬜ PHASE 3 — Portfolio Intelligence

---

### ✅ P3-A: Position Sizing Output in Recommendations *(completed 2026-05-13)*
**What it is:** `suggested_position_pct` field on every recommendation — how much % of portfolio to allocate.

| Condition | Suggested Size |
|---|---|
| MOS > 40% AND warren_score ≥ 70 AND confidence ≥ 75% | Full position (5% of portfolio) |
| MOS > 20% AND confidence ≥ 65% | Half position (2.5%) |
| MOS > 0% AND confidence ≥ 55% | Quarter position (1.25%) |
| MOS < 0% or confidence < 55% | Avoid (0%) |

**Files:** `agents/position_sizer.py` (new), `scheduler/orchestrator.py`, `agents/discovery_screener.py`, `api/main.py`, `dashboard/src/App.jsx`  
**DB migration:** `db/migrations/add_position_size_to_recommendations.sql` — adds `suggested_position_pct NUMERIC(5,2)` + `position_label TEXT`  
**Tests:** `tests/test_position_sizer.py` — 45 tests, all passing  
**Key details:**
- MOS source priority: warren_bot DCF `margin_of_safety_pct` → `upside_pct` proxy fallback
- FULL tier (5%) requires DCF-backed MOS — proxy cannot qualify (quality gate prevents false positives)
- AVOID/SELL actions always return 0% regardless of scores
- Wired into orchestrator after warren_bot attachment; also applied to discovery screener saves
- API: `suggestedPositionPct` + `positionLabel` in `_transform_recommendation()`
- Dashboard: 📐 position badge on both recommendation cards and discovery cards

---

### ✅ P3-B: Correlation-Aware Portfolio Alerts — DONE (2026-05-14)
**Implemented:** 60-day Pearson return correlation across all OPEN holdings.
Fires `CORR_CLUSTER` WARNING alert when ≥2 pairs exceed r=0.75, with 7-day dedup.
**Files:** `scheduler/portfolio_monitor.py` (`_compute_correlation_pairs`, `_check_correlation`)
**Tests:** `tests/test_portfolio_correlation.py` — 26 tests, all passing.

---

### ⬜ P3-C: Comprehensive Trendlyne Integration
**Status:** TODO  
**Why:** Trendlyne is not just a data fallback — it is a complete India equity intelligence platform offering signals not available anywhere else for free. Six distinct integration pillars make this the highest-ROI paid subscription in the stack.

---

#### What Trendlyne offers (evaluation summary)

| Module | What it provides | Current gap it fills |
|---|---|---|
| **DVM scores** | Pre-computed Durability (0–100) + Valuation (0–100) + Momentum (0–100) composite per stock | Discovery pre-screen has no quality-vs-price composite signal |
| **Fundamentals** | Full 10-yr annual series: revenue, PAT, EPS, CAGR, ROCE, promoter pledging, debt | warren_bot + discovery severely limited when screener.in blocked |
| **Analyst consensus** | Price target, EPS estimate, revenue estimate from 2–15 brokers per stock | No independent cross-check on our upside_pct |
| **Corporate filings / news** | BSE XML filings feed + earnings call transcripts + management commentary | Sentiment agent uses only Google News RSS — misses filings |
| **Insider/SAST trades** | Promoter buying/selling + SAST acquirer disclosures | No insider signal anywhere in current stack |
| **Corporate actions** | Dividends, splits, rights, bonus — calendar with dates | earnings_calendar auto-population (P2-D becomes part of this) |

---

#### Recommended subscription tier

| Tier | Price | Key unlocks |
|---|---|---|
| GuruQ | ₹310/month | 1,758 screener params, 75 alerts |
| **StratQ** *(recommended)* | **₹492/month** *(₹5,900/year)* | 3,500+ params, 300 real-time alerts, **unlimited data downloads**, full historical series |

> StratQ annual = ₹492/month ≈ $6/month. One alpha trade pays for multiple years.

---

#### Access method (no official API)
Trendlyne has **no public API**. Access via JSON endpoint scraping with session cookies — same pattern as `get_screener_data()` in `data/fetchers.py`.

```python
# Pattern (same as screener.in):
import requests
session = requests.Session()
session.cookies.set("sessionid", TRENDLYNE_SESSION_COOKIE)
session.cookies.set("csrftoken",  TRENDLYNE_CSRF_TOKEN)

# DVM scores:
r = session.get(f"https://trendlyne.com/equity/dvm-score/{symbol}/")
# Fundamental data:
r = session.get(f"https://trendlyne.com/equity/fundamental/{symbol}/ajax/")
# Analyst estimates:
r = session.get(f"https://trendlyne.com/equity/analyst-estimate/{symbol}/ajax/")
# Insider trades:
r = session.get(f"https://trendlyne.com/equity/insider-trades/{symbol}/ajax/")
# Corporate filings (BSE XML):
r = session.get(f"https://trendlyne.com/equity/bse-filings/{symbol}/ajax/")
```

Session cookie obtained from browser DevTools after manual login. Set as `TRENDLYNE_SESSION_COOKIE` + `TRENDLYNE_CSRF_TOKEN` env vars on Railway.

---

#### Integration architecture — 6 pillars in priority order

**Pillar 1 — Fundamental data (primary extension, not just fallback)**  
`data/trendlyne_fetcher.py` → `get_trendlyne_fundamentals(symbol)`:
- 10-yr annual revenue/PAT/EPS/CAGR series (replaces screener.in as primary for warren_bot historical series)
- Promoter pledging % (actual figure, not scraper estimate)
- ROCE consistency over 10 years (needed for moat_score)
- Returns `data_source: "trendlyne"`, `data_quality: "FULL"`

Integration: `data/fetchers.py::get_screener_data()` fallback chain becomes:
`screener.in → trendlyne → yfinance → None`

**Pillar 2 — Corporate actions → earnings_calendar (supersedes P2-D)**  
`data/trendlyne_fetcher.py` → `get_corporate_actions(symbols)`:
- Earnings result dates + board meeting dates from Trendlyne's BSE feed
- Daily refresh at 08:00 IST in `worker.py`
- Upserts to `earnings_calendar` table (already exists)
- Replaces P2-D (NSE bulletin + yfinance approach) — this is cleaner + richer

> **Note:** P2-D should be implemented as part of P3-C, not separately.

**Pillar 3 — DVM scores in discovery pre-screen**  
`agents/discovery_screener.py::prescreen()`:
- Add Filter 6 (optional, bonus): `dvm_momentum_score ≥ 45` (momentum not overheated)
- Add `valuation_score` to metadata — surfaced in discovery card on dashboard
- DVM Durability score enriches `data_quality` assessment

DVM score thresholds (Trendlyne's own scale):
- Durability: ≥ 60 = quality business, ≥ 80 = exceptional
- Valuation: 40–70 = reasonably priced, < 40 = cheap/deep-value, > 80 = expensive
- Momentum: 45–70 = constructive, > 80 = overheated/overbought

**Pillar 4 — Analyst consensus cross-validation**  
`agents/fundamental.py` enrichment (post-analysis):
- If `analyst_target_price` available AND our `intrinsic_value` differs by >30% → flag `valuation_divergence: true` in result
- Add `analyst_consensus_target` + `analyst_count` to recommendation metadata
- Synthesiser uses divergence flag as a confidence moderator (reduces confidence if analysts disagree by >30%)

**Pillar 5 — News + BSE filings in sentiment agent**  
`agents/sentiment.py`:
- Replace / augment current Google News RSS call with Trendlyne BSE filings feed
- Earnings call transcript NLP: extract management tone (capex guidance, revenue outlook, margin commentary) as structured sentiment signals
- Insider trades signal: `promoter_buying_3m` > 0 → +5 sentiment pts; `promoter_selling_3m > 2%` → -10 pts

**Pillar 6 — Insider/SAST signal in institutional agent**  
`agents/institutional.py`:
- New function `_get_insider_signal(symbol)` — fetches Trendlyne SAST disclosures
- SAST acquisition (bulk deal, open market buy by promoter) → `smart_money_signal: ACCUMULATING`
- Weighted +8 pts to institutional score when active promoter buying detected

---

#### New files / changes required

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `data/trendlyne_fetcher.py` | New module — all 6 fetch functions + session management |
| `data/fetchers.py` | Add trendlyne to fallback chain in `get_screener_data()` |
| `agents/fundamental.py` | Analyst consensus cross-check + valuation_divergence flag |
| `agents/sentiment.py` | BSE filings feed + transcript NLP + insider sentiment signal |
| `agents/institutional.py` | `_get_insider_signal()` from Trendlyne SAST |
| `agents/discovery_screener.py` | DVM Momentum filter + valuation_score to metadata |
| `agents/warren_bot.py` | Use trendlyne 10-yr series when screener.in unavailable |
| `scheduler/worker.py` | Daily corporate actions job at 08:00 IST |
| `db/migrations/` | No new tables needed — `earnings_calendar` already exists |

---

#### New environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `TRENDLYNE_SESSION_COOKIE` | Browser session cookie (rotate every ~30 days) |
| `TRENDLYNE_CSRF_TOKEN` | CSRF token paired with session cookie |

Add both to Railway `worker` + `web` services.

---

#### What this supersedes / absorbs

| Existing item | Disposition after P3-C |
|---|---|
| P2-A yfinance fallback | Remains as tier-3 fallback (screener.in → trendlyne → yfinance) |
| P2-D earnings calendar auto-populate | Absorbed into P3-C Pillar 2 — do not implement P2-D separately |
| Google News RSS in macro.py (BF-4) | Augmented — macro agent keeps RSS, sentiment agent gets Trendlyne filings |

---

#### Implementation order (within P3-C)

1. Set up `data/trendlyne_fetcher.py` with session management + test DVM endpoint
2. Wire Pillar 1 (fundamentals) into fallback chain — highest immediate ROI
3. Wire Pillar 2 (corporate actions → earnings_calendar) to replace P2-D
4. Wire Pillar 3 (DVM scores) into discovery pre-screen
5. Wire Pillar 4 (analyst consensus) into fundamental.py
6. Wire Pillar 5 (filings/transcripts) into sentiment.py
7. Wire Pillar 6 (insider/SAST) into institutional.py

**Effort estimate:** L-XL (8–16 hours). Can be done in pillars independently — Pillar 1 alone is a partial win.

---

## ⬜ PHASE 4 — Production Robustness

---

### ✅ P4-A: Warren Bot Commentary Grounding *(completed 2026-05-16)*
**Problem:** Claude Haiku commentary could say anything — free-form text with no constraint to cite actual numbers, making it possible to generate commentary that silently contradicted the real ROCE / EPS CAGR / MoS values computed by the scoring engine.

**Fix:**
1. **`_validate_commentary(text, anchor_values)`** — checks that ≥2 pre-formatted numeric strings (e.g. `"25.3"`, `"18.2"`) appear as substrings in the generated text. Returns `False` if fewer anchors found.
2. **`_build_grounded_commentary(symbol, score, signal, moat_type, roce_avg, eps_cagr, mos_pct)`** — deterministic template fallback that always embeds actual numbers. Tone calibrated to `signal`: AVOID=rejection language, QUALITY_BUY=cautiously positive, WATCHLIST=price-conditional.
3. **`_generate_commentary` rewritten** — asks Haiku for structured JSON `{"why_like": "...", "why_pass": "..."}` with an explicit prompt listing all data points and requiring ≥2 to be cited. After JSON parse, runs `_validate_commentary`; falls back to `_build_grounded_commentary` if validation fails or JSON is malformed.
4. **`signal` parameter added** — `analyse()` now passes `signal=signal` so commentary tone is consistent with the actual recommendation.

**Fallback chain (commentary always grounded):**
- No API key → `_build_grounded_commentary`
- API error → `_build_grounded_commentary`
- Non-JSON response → `_build_grounded_commentary`
- Valid JSON but validation fails (no real numbers cited) → `_build_grounded_commentary`
- Valid JSON + validation passes → LLM text used as-is

**Files changed:** `agents/warren_bot.py`  
**Tests:** `tests/test_warren_bot.py` — added 3 new test classes (27 tests): `TestValidateCommentary`, `TestBuildGroundedCommentary`, `TestGenerateCommentary`, `TestCommentaryGroundingIntegration`. All 62 warren_bot tests pass.

---

### ⬜ P4-B: Symbol Resolution Cache Persistence
**Current state:** `_symbol_cache` is process-memory only — cleared on every Railway redeploy.  
**Fix:** Use `symbol_resolutions` Supabase table (already exists) as persistent backing. Warm process cache from DB at startup.  
**Files:** `api/main.py` (`_resolve_yf_symbol()`)

---

### ✅ P4-C: Governance Numerical Grounding Check *(completed 2026-05-16)*
**Problem:** `fact_checker.py` passed every claim to Claude Haiku — including simple numeric comparisons where "PE is 40.0" vs actual PE=22.5 could be verified deterministically without an LLM. Haiku could silently agree with wrong numbers or produce false negatives.

**Fix — deterministic pre-LLM pass:**

1. **`_NUMERIC_TOLERANCES`** dict — per-metric tolerance config:
   - Relative tolerances (fraction of actual): `pe` ±15%, `revenue_growth` ±20%, `ebitda_margin/debt_equity` ±10–15%, `roce/roe` ±10%, `ema50/ema20` ±2%
   - Absolute tolerances (units): `promoter_holding` ±2pp, `promoter_pledging` ±2pp, `rsi` ±5 points

2. **`_extract_numeric_from_source(metric_key, source_name, cached_data)`** — extracts actual value from already-fetched source cache:
   - Screener.in dict → direct key lookup
   - OHLCV DataFrame → computes RSI (Wilder EMA), EMA20, EMA50

3. **`_numerical_grounding_check(claims, source_cache, symbol)`** — pre-LLM pass:
   - For each claim in `_NUMERIC_TOLERANCES`: extract actual, compare, set `claim.status`:
     - Within tolerance → `"VERIFIED"` (Haiku skipped)
     - Outside tolerance → `"CONTRADICTED"` + `corrected_claim` set (Haiku skipped)
     - Unavailable → status unchanged → Haiku handles it
   - Returns count of deterministically resolved claims (logged)

4. **`_verify_claim` updated** — skips Haiku entirely if `claim.status` already set

5. **`_check_one` updated** — calls `_numerical_grounding_check` before the Haiku loop; logs how many claims were resolved deterministically

**Impact:**
- PE, ROCE, promoter holding, EBITDA margin, RSI, EMA claims verified/contradicted without LLM calls
- Eliminates false negatives where Haiku "agrees" with a wrong number
- Produces exact corrected values: *"Actual ROCE is 8.2%, not 30.0%"*
- Reduces Haiku API calls for numeric-heavy recommendations (typically 3–5 of 7 claims)

**Files changed:** `governance/fact_checker.py`  
**New file:** `tests/test_fact_checker.py` — 40 tests covering `_extract_numeric_from_source`, `_numerical_grounding_check`, `_verify_claim` skip behaviour, and integration with `_check_one`

---

### ⬜ P4-D: Replace Breeze Connect with Angel One SmartAPI (Live Options)
**Priority:** Lowest — Trendlyne F&O already works well as primary options source.  
**What changes:**
- Remove `data/breeze_auth.py` (deprecated per CLAUDE.md P4-D note)
- Remove Breeze plumbing from `data/options_fetcher.py`
- Add `data/angel_one_fetcher.py` — Angel One SmartAPI client for live option chain
- New options source priority: **Angel One → Trendlyne F&O → NSE → VIX proxy**

**Why Angel One over Breeze:**
- Free with any Angel One demat account (no separate API portal fee)
- SmartAPI is well-documented (`pip install smartapi-python`)
- Real strike-level OI, IV, bid/ask — same quality as Breeze
- Supports automated daily session refresh via Client ID + Password + TOTP

**Angel One SmartAPI — what it provides:**
- `get_option_chain(symbol, expiry)` → full strike table with OI, volume, IV, bid/ask
- Real PCR, max pain, ATM IV, IV skew — all computable from live OI data
- Historical OHLCV as bonus (can supplement yfinance)

**New env vars needed (add to Railway worker + web):**
| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `ANGEL_ONE_API_KEY` | From smartapi.angelbroking.com → Apps |
| `ANGEL_ONE_CLIENT_ID` | Your Angel One login ID |
| `ANGEL_ONE_PASSWORD` | Your Angel One login password |
| `ANGEL_ONE_TOTP_SECRET` | Base32 TOTP secret (from 2FA setup) — enables automated daily token refresh |

**Current credential status:** Client ID + Password available. TOTP secret TBD (scan QR from Angel One 2FA settings).

**Files to change:**
- `data/angel_one_fetcher.py` — NEW: session manager + `get_option_chain()` + `_parse_chain()`
- `data/options_fetcher.py` — replace Breeze tier with Angel One tier; keep rest of fallback chain
- `data/breeze_auth.py` — DELETE
- `worker.py` — replace `job_breeze_token_refresh()` with `job_angel_one_token_refresh()` at 08:30 IST
- `requirements.txt` — swap `breeze-connect` → `smartapi-python`

**Effort:** M (3–6 hrs)

---

## ⬜ PHASE 5 — Forward Paper Portfolio Tracker

*Build after Phase 0–4 complete.*

---

### ⬜ P5-A: Enhanced Outcome Tracker + Attribution
**Gaps in current `outcome_tracker.py`:**
1. No confidence calibration (does 80% confidence actually win 80%?)
2. No agent-level attribution (which agent's signal was most predictive?)
3. No portfolio-level Sharpe from recommendation set

**New file:** `agents/performance_analyzer.py`  
**Worker job:** Weekly Sundays 08:00 IST  

---

### ⬜ P5-B: Paper Portfolio Simulation Mode
**What it does:** Simulates ₹10,000 per BUY rec from start date → tracks portfolio value vs NIFTY50.  
**Files:** `agents/paper_portfolio.py`, `GET /api/performance/paper-portfolio`

---

## ⬜ PHASE 6 — Dashboard & Reporting

*Data won't be meaningful until Aug 2025+. Build last.*

---

### ⬜ P6-A: System Performance Dashboard Tab
Shows: hit rate %, avg alpha at 90/180d, confidence calibration chart, top 5 best/worst calls, agent accuracy leaderboard.

## OPTIONS DATA DECISION FLOWCHART

```
Do you already have a demat account with Upstox?
  YES → Use Upstox API (free) — see P1-B Upstox setup steps
  NO  → Open free Upstox account (15 min)
        OR sign up for Quantsapp Pro (₹2,499/month — simpler integration)

Quantsapp: Pre-computed PCR/max pain/IV skew — 1 API call per symbol
Upstox:    Free but needs daily token refresh job + our own PCR/max pain computation
